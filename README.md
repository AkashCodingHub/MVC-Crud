CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) are fundamental to any application dealing with data.
In the context of ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller), CRUD operations are implemented to manage data efficiently
by separating concerns into different layers. Here's an overview of each aspect in an MVC context:

1. Create (Insert Data)
Purpose: Adds new records to the database.

Model: Defines the structure (class) representing the data entity.
Controller: Contains an action method (HttpGet to display the form and HttpPost to handle form submission).
View: Provides the user interface for entering data.

2. Read (Retrieve Data)
Purpose: Fetch and display records from the database.

Model: Represents data fetched from the database.
Controller: Contains action methods for fetching and returning data to views.
View: Displays the data, often using HTML tables.

3. Update (Edit Data)
Purpose: Modify existing records.

Controller: Action methods handle displaying and updating records (HttpGet to fetch the data, HttpPost to save changes).
View: Provides the form pre-populated with the existing data.
